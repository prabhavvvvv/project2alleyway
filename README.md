# Pulse Link

## Project Description
This project is an ankle band that reacts based on ambient background movement. It is controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller that is positioned within the band in order to read one's pulse. There is an LED strip that flashes whenever background movement is detected. Additionally, the band is able to vibrate and glow depending on one's pulse, as it is powered by a 3.7V Li-on battery and a TP4056 charger that powers tge circuit.
